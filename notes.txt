BUGS TO LOOK INTO
1. There is bug when loading entity data in chunks (often comes after a crash or reloading a chunk)
2. Current Astar does not take into account size of entity
3. Posistion will break when non-square entities rotate since we track from top left (might need to rework entities to track from middle)
